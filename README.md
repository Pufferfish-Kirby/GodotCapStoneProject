# Godot Capstone Project: The Eggcellent Adventures

The purpose of this project is to make a 2D platformer game in Godot about an egg trying to find its shell. 

By the end of this project, I hope to have a game with five different levels, pixel art designs for the character and the enemies, and to make a cute feeling out of this game. In return, this game will be challenging but fun simultaneously.
